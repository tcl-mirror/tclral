========= ral 0.8.1 =========

Version 0.8.1 is an incremental release that is backward compatible at the
script level. There have been a number of code base improvements.  Several new
commands were added that experience indicated were useful. Several commands
have new optional arguments. The biggest new feature is relvar tracing. It is
now possible to define a trace on a relvar and intercede in some of the relvar
operations.  A new package called "ralutil" is included that contains some
useful procs. The "ralutil" package is, in places, quite experimental as
subject to interface changes. There is no documentation yet for the "ralutil"
package, but that will come later as the interfaces stabilize.  However, I
wanted a place to try out new things without cluttering the main "ral" package.

Overview of the script visible changes from Version 0.8 to Version 0.8.1

1. Added "relvar trace" command. This allows setting traces on relvar
    operations.

2. Added the commands "relvar union", "relvar intersect", "relvar
    minus". These are shorthands for performing the indicated operation
    and assigning the result back into the relvar.

3. Added the "relation create" command so that relation values can be
    created without reference to the string representation of the relation.
    Compare with "tuple create"

4. Added the command "relation body" to return the body of a relation. The
    body is a list of tuple values, each of which is a dictionary of
    attribute name / attribute value pairs.

5. Added "relation reidentify" to change the identifiers of a relation
    value.  Occasionally it is desirable to change identifiers when by
    context other information is known about a relation value.

6. Modified "relation array" and "relation dict" to accept optional
    arguments for the key attribute name and value attribute name. This
    makes it more convenient so that projecting out a binary relation
    is not strictly required now.

7. Create a "ralutil" package as part of the release to hold utility procs
    and other experimental script code.

========= ral 0.8 =========
Version 0.8 is a complete refactoring and rewrite of the extension.
The source has been split among many files and there was a concerted
attempt to have an internal "C" API separated from the Tcl portions.
The biggest new feature is support for referential integrity constraints.
Support for virtual relvars (i.e. views) has been removed, but may come
back later when whole area is better understood.

========= ral 0.7 =========
Organization of the source code did not change in this version. It is still a
single (albeit rather large) "C" file. The "relformat" utility is also still
implemented as script. However, the build procedure is now TEA compliant.

========= ral 0.6 =========
TCLRAL is contained in a single "C" source file. My apologies that the build
mechanisms are so primative. I'll improve then in future releases. As it stands
now, you need only compile the single source file to produce a shared
library.  A utility procedure, "relformat", is included as Tcl script. The
"pkgIndex.tcl" file handles the load and source necessary to get everything
loaded.
