This is TclRAL a relational algebra library extention for Tcl.

INSTALLATION
============

Installation follows the typical TEA scheme. On most UNIX or Linux systems
it should be sufficient to unwrap the source and:

% ./configure
% make
% make install

Configure typically needs to know where Tcl is installed on your system
via the "--with-tcl=...." argument. You may also wish to remove the
assertions by defining "CPPFLAGS=-DNDEBUG" as an environment variable.

This also works more or less on Windows system using MSys or Cygwin.
I build the Windows binary distributes using MSys.

BINARY DISTRIBUTION
===================

If you have selected to use one of the binary distributions, then it is
only necessary to un-tar or un-zip the file into a directory that is along
your Tcl library path. This could be in the "lib" directory of your
Tcl installation (a common practice under Windows) or in any directory
that is mentioned in the TCLLIBPATH environment variable. Binary distributions
come with documentation and test cases located in directories below the
package files.
