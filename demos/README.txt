This directory contains a very primative demonstation program that can
view a set of relations using the excellent Tktable widget. I have spent
very little time on this demo and it shows. Currently you cannot modify
any relation values. I'll improve this in the future as a viewing tool
is almost essential. For now, the "create-parts.tcl" is a small script
that generates the output contained in "parts.tcl". That file may be
viewed with "ralview.tcl"
